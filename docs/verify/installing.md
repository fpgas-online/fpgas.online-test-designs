# fpgas-verify: installing it

You have a Raspberry Pi with an FPGA board attached and want to install `fpgas-verify` for that board.
Every fpgas-verify page is listed in [fpgas-verify](../verify.md).

## Installing

```bash
# The fpgas.online apt repository (bookworm or trixie).
sudo install -d -m0755 /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://apt.fpgas.online/apt.gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/apt.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/apt.gpg] https://apt.fpgas.online/$(. /etc/os-release; echo $VERSION_CODENAME)/ ./" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt.list

# fpgas.online's openFPGALoader; add it before installing. A NeTV2 on a Pi 5 needs it. Elsewhere Debian's own
# works from 0.13.0 on (trixie), but bookworm's (0.10.0) is too old: it cannot read the device DNA.
curl -fsSL https://fpgas.online/fpgas.online-fpga-tools/fpgas.online-fpga-tools.gpg \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/fpgas.online-fpga-tools.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/fpgas.online-fpga-tools.gpg] https://fpgas.online/fpgas.online-fpga-tools/$(. /etc/os-release; echo $VERSION_CODENAME)/ ./" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fpgas.online-fpga-tools.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install fpgas-online-arty         # the package for your board: see the table
sudo apt install fpgas-online-arty-debug   # optional: fpgas-arty-debug, for when the check fails
```

Install **one** of these. They conflict, so a host is never set up for two boards by accident.

| Package | Installs |
|---|---|
| `fpgas-online-acorn` | everything to check a Sqrl Acorn CLE-215+ / CLE-101 (and LiteFury), and turns the boot check on for it |
| `fpgas-online-arty` | everything to check a Digilent Arty A7-35T, and turns the boot check on for it |
| `fpgas-online-netv2` | everything to check a Kosagi NeTV2 (XC7A35T or XC7A100T), and turns the boot check on for it |
| `fpgas-online-fomu` | everything to check a Fomu EVT, and turns the boot check on for it |
| `fpgas-online-tt-fpga` | everything to check a TT FPGA Demo Board, and turns the boot check on for it |
| `fpgas-online-all-boards` | everything to check any of the boards, and turns the boot check on for whichever is found |
| `fpgas-online-multi-board` | turns the boot check on for whichever board is found, of those whose `fpgas-online-<board>-tools` you also install |

* `fpgas-online-<board>-debug` adds `fpgas-<board>-debug` and the tools for the tests the boot check skips.
* Installing does not run the check. It runs at the next boot, or when you run it.
* The packages are `Architecture: all`: they install on Raspberry Pi OS and on an x86 machine alike. The NeTV2
  and the Acorn need a Pi's GPIO header; the Arty, Fomu and TT FPGA board need only USB.
* Versions are `0.0.postN` from `git describe` (for example `0.0.post771`). Each package depends on the others'
  exact version, so `sudo apt upgrade` moves them together.
* Each board's page lists what its packages pull in: [acorn](../hardware/acorn.md#installing-the-acorn-packages),
  [arty-a7](../hardware/arty-a7.md#installing-the-arty-packages), [netv2](../hardware/netv2.md#installing-the-netv2-packages),
  [fomu-evt](../hardware/fomu-evt.md#installing-the-fomu-packages), [tt-fpga](../hardware/tt-fpga.md#installing-the-tt-fpga-packages).
* CI builds every package and checks its install rules in clean bookworm and trixie
  ([`collect-bitstreams.yml`](../../.github/workflows/collect-bitstreams.yml),
  [`build_debs.py`](../../packaging/debs/build_debs.py), [`install_test.sh`](../../packaging/debs/install_test.sh)).
